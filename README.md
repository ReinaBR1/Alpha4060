# Alpha4060
For your first project update, please address any comments regarding your initial mission concept from the project proposal,  and:

# Requirements
Ensure that you have all of the top level requirements listed (as given in the Project Description)
Calculate the Keplerian orbital elements for your spacecraft in each phase of your proposed mission. Clearly identify the central body of each orbit and explain what your orbit will look like at this point in the mission. Diagrams are incredibly helpful here.
Estimate the total ∆v of your mission. List all assumptions you are making.
If your trajectory could benefit from a gravitational assist, describe it and calculate the expected ∆v. If your mission will involve proximity operations or intercept and rendezvous, describe the maneuvers and expected burns required.

# Extra Credit
Identify all major sources of perturbations for your spacecraft throughout its mission.  Estimate (order of magnitude is okay) the perturbation effects on all orbital elements calculated above. If you do not believe there are significant perturbations during a given mission phase, clearly explain why.
For this (and all subsequent project updates) you may (and are encouraged to) simply add new sections to your initial writeup and continue building the document that will become your final submission. Please identify whether you are a 4060 or a 5065 group at the top of your writeup.
